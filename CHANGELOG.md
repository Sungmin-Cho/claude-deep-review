# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **fitness.json integration** — Stage 3 now loads `.deep-review/fitness.json` (if present) and injects computational architecture rules into the code-reviewer agent prompt for architecture-intent-aware review
- **Receipt health_report integration** — Stage 3 discovers the latest deep-work session receipt, checks `scan_commit` for staleness, and injects drift/fitness context into the review
- **Fitness Function awareness in code-reviewer** — New "Fitness Function 인지" section guides the reviewer to evaluate design intent alignment, not just rule violations
- **fitness.json guidance in init mode** — `/deep-review init` now explains the distinction between inferential rules (rules.yaml) and computational rules (fitness.json) and directs users to deep-work Phase 1 for auto-generation
